              <p>Tucked between the computer science department’s home in Sudikoff Hall, the Moore Psychology Building and the Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center, the McLaughlin cluster is home to roughly 340 students from a range of class years. The cluster includes Occom Commons, one of the largest residential social spaces on campus, as well as close proximity to the College’s 18-hole golf course and Occom Pond, the site of Dartmouth’s infamous Winter Carnival “Polar Bear Plunge.”</p>

              <p>Arranged around a central walkway and courtyard, the hotel-esque cluster is named to honor former College President David McLaughlin ’54 Tu’55.</p>

                “The rooms are ridiculously nice. What I really liked, especially being a UGA, is that people really seemed to acknowledge it was a nice place to live and respected that.” --<em>Caroline Allan ’16, Undergraduate Advisor 2013, Berry 2</em>

              <p>
                “I liked that it was really new. A lot of my friends lived in older dorms, where the rooms were old and sad looking. [But] I didn’t like how far it was from food. You have to plan ahead for meals for the next morning. You can’t just wake up at 8:30 and be like ‘I want FoCo’ if you have a 9L.” --<em>Rachel Porth ’16, Thomas 3</em>
