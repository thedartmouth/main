              <p>Located across from Alumni Gym and within sight of the Bema, East Wheelock is known for its focus on community, its faculty-in-residence program and its late-night snack bar, which keeps residents well-stocked with candy, sugary drinks and all manner of dorm-room essentials.</p>

              <p>While “East Wheezy” is traditionally associated with the academic intensity of its residents, it is also often home to student-athletes seeking a shorter walk to the gym in the winter months and older residents who choose the dorm for its spacious suites and programming. Brace Commons, an open social space, hosts events throughout the year, and McCulloch International Residence, affinity housing program students arriving on-campus from outside the U.S., are also located in the cluster.</p>

              <p>Across its buildings, East Wheelock houses approximately 340 students from all class years.</p>

                “[East Wheelock] is full of generally motivated and kind people, not necessarily the most ‘ragey.’ Be very purposeful in reaching out to each other, because it might seem a little hard, but it will really pay off.” --<em>Xanthe Kraft ’16, Andres 3</em>

                “I lived in East Wheelock for two years, and I think the thing I liked the most about it is that there were always people around. I really liked my [freshman year] room because it was a suite, which is really hard for a freshman to get ... Participate in the events that are held in East Wheelock, because they are really cool. You live there, so take advantage of that.” --<em>Song Heui Cho ’16, Andres 3</em>
