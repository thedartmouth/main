              <p>Located on Tuck Drive just by Silsby Hall, home of some social science departments, the Russell Sage cluster boasts residential social spaces including the Cellar and the Hyphen, both recently renovated to better meet the needs of first-year students. This year, first-year students will live in the cluster’s Butterfield Hall, which has recently hosted transfer and exchange students, because of the Class of 2018’s large size. Butterfield and Russell Sage house approximately 177 students.</p>

                “Living in Butterfield was super nice. It’s very well-situated. Be sure to interact with people on the floor -— not a lot of people who live there talk to each other. Take advantage of meeting all the people who live there.” --<em>Kwaishon Bell ’16, Butterfield 1</em>

                “[Russell Sage] was the best dorm in the best location. It’s close to the library, close to food and close to fraternity row.” --<em>Ben Wood ’16, Russell Sage 4</em>
