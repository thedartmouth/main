              <p>While technically a part of the Russell Sage cluster, the modern Fahey-McLane Hall is distinct in both architectural design and inclusion of upperclassmen suites on many floors. Home to around 205 students, Fahey and McLane are connected by a set of open common rooms on each floor, allowing the two dorms to serve for most intents and purposes as a single building. Like Russell Sage, Fahey-McLane is prized for its close location to Silsby, the Rockefeller Center and Baker-Berry Library.</p>

                “I think I had the best room on campus. The physical plant is great — it’s clean, big enough. You could have a TV and a couch and feel very comfortable. I think I had pretty much the dream scenario.” --<em>Jackson Dean ’16, Fahey 2</em>
