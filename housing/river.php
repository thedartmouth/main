              <p>Located behind the Thayer School of Engineering, the River compensates for its comparative distance from many campus amenities with spacious rooms and a rich sense of community. Home to both first-year residents who live in French Hall and Judge Hall, and upperclassmen who take advantage of the kitchens and common rooms offered in Maxwell and Channing Cox’s four-person apartments, the cluster houses the Dartmouth Outing Club’s climbing gym, the Max Kade German center and apartments reserved for student members of Hillel and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Each year, the cluster is home to approximately 320 students.</p>

                “A lot of my very good friends to this day are people I met in the River. We bonded a lot. There were no one-room doubles, so that helped simplify some of the roommate interactions quite a bit.” --<em>Anne Reed-Weston ’16, French 4</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                “I found some of my best friends in the River — the entire dorm was really close. You could tell it was on the older side, but what was nice about it was that you either had a single or a two or three room double, so you had the experience of having a roommate while having your own space.” --<em>Emily Tregidgo ’16, French 2</em>
